tldr; - The biggest problem on the internet is too much data
<!-- excerpt-end -->

There is just too much data on the internet for any sane person to go through and reasonably explore and extract information from efficiently.  The future of information on the internet will likely be curated content that may or may not be locked behind paywalls.  Wikipedia is an example of curated content that is generally free but susceptible to some set of issues that are widely known.  Online technical course ware that requires a subscription would be an example paid curation.
