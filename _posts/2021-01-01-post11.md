WSL2 environment differs when accessing windows file systems. 
<!-- excerpt-end -->


Recently I was adding ssh keys my WSL2 environment to simplify version control activities on Git.  After generating the public/private key pairs, I received an error when attempting to run the following command to add the SSH private keys to my authentication agent.
```shell
ssh-add ./id2_ed25519  #id_ed25519 it the private SSH key file
/mnt/d$ ssh-add ./id2_ed25519
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
@         WARNING: UNPROTECTED PRIVATE KEY FILE!          @
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Permissions 0777 for './id2_ed25519' are too open.
It is required that your private key files are NOT accessible by others.
This private key will be ignored.
```

Upon doing some troubleshooting, chmod commands did not have the desired effect-
```shell
ls -lart
-rwxrwxrwx 1 ali  ali         102 Apr 25 22:13  id2_ed25519.pub
chmod 500 id2_ed25519.pub
ls -lart
-r-xr-xr-x 1 ali  ali         102 Apr 25 22:13  id2_ed25519.pub
```

It turns out I was running the commands in a windows directory(for ease of use with a windows-based code editor).  The WSL2 environment does not have full access controls for files in the host file system.

Copying the key files to my home directory (~), allowed chmod to correctly apply the file permissions and add it to the authentication agent.

Further reading is recommended to locate file and directory permissions documentation when using WSL2.
