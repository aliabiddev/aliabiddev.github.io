Bank of America experiences a major outage in the middle of a weekday
<!-- excerpt-end -->

Upon trying to access the bank of america website on laptop this morning, I found I was unable to actually login.  There was an outage.

Even the mobile application appeared to be down.

Merrill edge, Bank of America's service for investors appears to be available however.  And that's a good thing for them since if a subset of investers did not have access to trade during the middle of a trading day, that would be a huge reglatory issue.

It should be noted these applications and servies were being accessed from US-EAST region, so its possible that it may be a regional issue.  No immediate root cause or resolution is presented as of 12pm EST today.
