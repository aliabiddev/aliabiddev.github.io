tldr; - A set of relevant Definitions in my own words on the practicality of static site generators in 2021

Site: A page or collection of pages typically using HTML that are used to display content to other users
Static site: A site that does not rely on dynamic content, and all resources on the site are served statically without additional server computations
Dynamic content: Content that requires a server to perform computations and/or logic or retrieves data from a backend before serving it to a user
Static site generator: An application or executable that can be used to generate a static site from a collection of templates and content pages

It is true that most interesting content on the web as of 2021 is dynamically generated, but a lot of times, there is no need for dynamic content when static content would suffice.  If there is no desired input to be requested from  users and site information is relatively static, a site generator could provide substantial performance improvements and simpler architecture.
