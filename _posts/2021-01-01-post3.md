build in small steps
<!-- excerpt-end -->

The ability to build a relatively complex thing all in one time is a skill reserved for only a few.  It is much easier to create a plan and follow small measurable steps towards a large goal.  This basic understanding of human nature is the reason why iterative development is generally proven to be a better method of implementing something new.  This new thing may not necessarily be software.  The same concept could certainly apply in the domains of content creation, policy implementation, and relationship development to name a few.

Measurement of a thing being built or developed is psychologically rewarding for the builder.  The ability to see real world effect of the thing being created leads to reward and makes the visibility of that item much more real, rather than an abstract idea.
