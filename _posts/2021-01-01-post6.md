Small steps lead to big changes
<!-- excerpt-end -->

It can be pretty difficult to keep a good routine going at times.  Especially when its just starting out.  There are a million and one things that could come in the way to keep doing something.  This is all a part of being able to execute under a pressured situation, whether that situation is internal or genuinely caused by external factors.  

The key thing to remember is that change does not happen over night.  It is a series of small steps and movements towards a specific direction that will cause about an overall change over a period of time.  It is possible for there to be a sudden change that could cause great havoc on a routine, but even then the individual will tend to normalize towards the routine they had before that calamitous event.  The actual change that is everlasting is almost always the result of personal effort and perseverance.

But as always, the above observations should be taken with a grain of salt, and a glass of water.
